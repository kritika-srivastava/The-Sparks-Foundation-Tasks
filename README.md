### # Task-1 : Prediction using Supervised ML (Level - Beginner)
_Please click on the images on right side to view my solution._

1. Predict the percentage of marks of an student based on the number of study hours.
1. This is a simple linear regression task as it involves just 2 variables.
1. Data can be found at [http://bit.ly/w](http://bit.ly/w)
1. You can use R, Python, SAS Enterprise Miner or any other tool.
1. What will be predicted score if a student studies for 9.25 hrs/ day?

### # Task-3 : Prediction using Decision Tree Algorithm(Level - Intermediate)
_Please click on the images on right side to view my solution._

1. For the given ‘Iris’ dataset, create the Decision Tree classifier and visualize it graphically.
1. The purpose is if we feed any new data to this classifier, it would be able to predict the right class accordingly.

### # Task-4 : Stock Market Prediction using Numerical and Textual Analysis (Level - Advanced)
_Please click on the images on right side to view my solution._

**NOTE : If you face any issue over dataset then please refer to the thread of [Issue #2](https://github.com/kritika-srivastava/The-Sparks-Foundation-Tasks/issues/2).**

1. Create a hybrid model for stock price/performance prediction using numerical analysis of historical stock prices, and sentimental analysis of news headlines.
1. Stock to analyze and predict SENSEX (S&P BSE SENSEX)
1. Download historical stock prices from [finance.yahoo.com](https://finance.yahoo.com/?guccounter=1)
1. Download textual (news) data from [https://bit.ly/36fFPI6](https://bit.ly/36fFPI6)
1. Use either R or Python, or both for separate analysis and then combine the findings to create a hybrid model.
